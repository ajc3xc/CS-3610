## Testing The Web Server With the Browser
![web_server_image] (iactuallytestedthis-web_server.png)
* In this screenshot I tested my web server with use in the browser by running the program in the terminal
  and making a request using mozilla firefox. The request was successful, and returned hello_world.html.

## Testing The Web Server With the Client
![client_browser_image] (iactuallytestedthis-client_browser.png)
* In this screenshot I tested my client browser by running web_server.py in the background,
  and then requested web_files/hello_world.html, which then returned the html document on the terminal.

## Notes About My Setup
* I used Ubuntu 23.04 running a Docker environment
* I installed docker and git from the base installation of ubuntu, but nothing else was installed
* On a previous test, I used Ubuntu 22.04 and used a Mamba environment to install my packages
